This repository hosts Omegion's [Helm](https://helm.sh) charts. Chart documentation is automatically generated using [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs)

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add omegion https://charts.omegion.dev
```

You can then run `helm search repo omegion` to see the charts.
